v1.22

ESP32 support for MAX485, MAX3485 and the 3.3V/5V red module containing at MAX13847E now confirmed.

There is now no longer the need to specify a baud rate or inverter.  Alpha2MQTT will iterate through all known baud-rates on boot and once communication established, will use that baud rate going forward.

Based on V1.21, if you use an OLED screen which doesn't have an RST solder point or switch, please clear OLED_HAS_RST_PIN in Definitions.h to false.  If you use an OLED shield for an ESP8266 or the OLED display otherwise has an RST pin, set this to true.
