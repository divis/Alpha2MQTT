v1.26

REQUIRE_DELAY_DUE_TO_INCONSISTENT_RETRIEVAL:

After some liaison with a user of Alpha2MQTT on a 115200 baud rate who was suffering with sporadic NO-RESP,
the following change helped fixed inconsistent retrieval.

It introduces a slight delay between requests to the inverter to give it room to 'breathe'

If you are in this scenario, and want to try playing with delays:
At the top of Definitions.h, uncomment
//#define REQUIRE_DELAY_DUE_TO_INCONSISTENT_RETRIEVAL

80ms is a default starting point which is 1/12 of a second.  If it corrects the issue try reducing the delay to 60,
40, etc until you find a happy place.
#define REQUIRED_DELAY_DUE_TO_INCONSISTENT_RETRIEVAL 80
